             * THE 12 COMMANDMENTS 
             * 1 Get the requirement from the user - what App to build
             * 2 Give the requirement to the architect/software designer for overview
             * 3 Reiceive specification from analyst to developer
             * 4 For each item on the requirement specification determine the proposed functions
             * 5 For each function we can calculate the expected input and output
             * 6 From there input/output we can write some tests which expect this output given input
             * 7 We add these test to out application and run it
             * 8 The test will fail
             * 9 We write the minimum code to pass the test
             * 10 Once the test goes from red to green, i.e fail to pass, we are done
             * 11 Final step is to refactor our code to ensure it is as efficient as possible
             * 12 Repeat 6 to 11 until all items in the requirement specification are a complete.
